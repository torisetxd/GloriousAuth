# Glorious Auth
Very simple to use (probably overengineered) but secure auth plugin.
This **only works on Paper not Spigot nor Bukkit.**

### Commands
- /gauth - For help
- /gauth setspawn - Sets the spawn to teleport people to when logging in.
- /gauth reload - Reload the config.
- /login <password> - To login
- /register <password> <password> - To register

### Permission
`gauth.admin` is the permission for being able to use any of the /gauth commands.

Thats about it.
